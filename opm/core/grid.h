/**
   Data structure for an unstructured grid, unstructured meaning that
   any cell may have an arbitrary number of adjacent cells. The struct
   contains both topological and geometrical data.

   The grid consists of a set of cells, which are assumed to partion
   the grid domain. A face is defined as the nonempty intersection of
   (the closure of) two grid cells (the grid is a cell complex).

   The topology information is limited to some adjacency relations
   between cells, faces and nodes only. The data structure does not
   contain any information pertaining to edges (except in 2d, where
   edges are the same as faces).

   The geometry information is limited to centroids, areas/volumes and
   normals.
